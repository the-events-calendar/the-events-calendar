== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar. If you‚Äôre running Events Calendar PRO or  any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you‚Äôll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren‚Äôt going to say ‚Äútough luck‚Äù if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can‚Äôt guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin's [WordPress.org forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/), which we visit about once a week. Please make sure to read [our sticky post](https://evnt.is/19oc) providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a license for Events Calendar Pro.

If you're already an Events Calendar Pro user, you're entitled access to our actively-monitored [Premium Support](https://evnt.is/1aju) on our website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all tickets within 24-48 hours during the business week.

= What's the difference between The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro? =

The Events Calendar is our cornerstone plugin, and it‚Äôs required in order to run any of our premium calendar add-ons, including Events Calendar Pro, Community Events, Filter Bar, and others.

In other words, Events Calendar Pro runs alongside The Events Calendar and enhances it with extra features, including recurring events, additional calendar views, calendar shortcodes, advanced widgets, custom event fields and more.

= What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar, and where can I read more about them? =

The following add-ons are available for The Events Calendar:

* [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), for adding premium calendar features like recurring events, advanced views, cool widgets, [shortcodes](https://evnt.is/1ajw), additional fields, and more!
* [Event Aggregator](https://evnt.is/197u), a service that effortlessly fills your calendar with events from Meetup, Google Calendar, iCalendar, Eventbrite, CSV, and ICS.
* [Virtual Events](https://evnt.is/1aky), which optimizes your calendar for virtual events including Zoom integration, video and livestream embeds, SEO optimization for online events and more.
* [Event Tickets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/) (free), which allows you to sell tickets and collect RSVPs to events. It can run alongside The Events Calendar or as a standalone plugin that adds ticket and RSVP functionality to WordPress posts and pages.
* [Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk), which allows you to sell tickets for your events using your favorite e-commerce platform.
* [Event Tickets Wallet Plus](https://evnt.is/etwp), for adding digital tickets like Apple Wallet passes and PDF tickets.
* [Promoter](https://evnt.is/1ajt), automated email communication made just for The Events Calendar and Event Tickets. Stay in touch with your attendees every step of the way.
* [Community Events](https://evnt.is/2g), for allowing frontend event submission from your readers.
* [Community Tickets](https://evnt.is/18wl), which allows event organizers to sell tickets to the events they submit via Community Events.
* [Filter Bar](https://evnt.is/fa), for adding advanced frontend filtering capabilities to your events calendar.
* [Eventbrite Tickets](https://evnt.is/2e), for selling tickets to your event directly through Eventbrite.

= Can I import events to my calendar? =

Yes! The Events Calendar has a built-in CSV import tool. If you want to step it up and automatically import events from Google Calendar, Meetup, Eventbrite and more, check out [Event Aggregator](https://evnt.is/197u).

= How do I sell tickets to events on my calendar? =

You'll want to use our [Event Tickets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/) plugin for that. This free plugin works alongside The Events Calendar and lets you create RSVPs and tickets for events. Event Tickets integrates with PayPal so you can collect payments for tickets, while our premium solution, Event Tickets Plus fully integrates with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads. If you want to include digital tickets like Apple Wallet passes and PDF tickets check out [Event Tickets Wallet Plus](https://evnt.is/etwp).

= Can I have more than one calendar on my site? =

Unfortunately, no. However, you can use [event categories](https://evnt.is/1bay) or tags to create calendar views that only display certain events. For example, you could create a direct link to a calendar view that only shows events categorized as ‚ÄúFitness,‚Äù [like this example from our demo site](https://evnt.is/1ajv).

With [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), you can use [shortcodes](https://evnt.is/1ajw) to embed your calendar on other WordPress pages and posts, then filter that calendar by category.

= Can I allow people to submit events to my calendar? =

This is available with the [Community Events](https://evnt.is/2g) add-on to facilitate submissions. Install Community Events alongside The Events Calendar and a page will be added to your WordPress site with a form that visitors can use to submit events. As the calendar owner, you have full control over whether event submissions are published immediately or require moderation first.

If you want to let users sell tickets for the events they submit, check out [Community Tickets](https://evnt.is/18wl). It runs with The Events Calendar, Community Events, and Event Tickets and empowers visitors to create and sell tickets, splitting the profits with you.

= What‚Äôs the difference between The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro =

The Events Calendar is our cornerstone plugin, and it‚Äôs required in order to run any of our premium calendar add-ons, including [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), [Community Events](https://evnt.is/1bax), [Filter Bar](https://evnt.is/fa), and others.

In other words, Events Calendar Pro runs alongside The Events Calendar and enhances it with extra features, including recurring events and event Series, additional calendar views, calendar shortcodes, advanced widgets, custom event fields, a duplicate event tool, and more.


= I have a feature idea. What's the best way to tell you about it? =

We've got an [ideas page](https://app.loopedin.io/the-events-calendar-suite-roadmap#/ideas) where we're actively watching for feature ideas from the community. Vote up existing feature requests or add your own, and help us shape [our roadmap](https://app.loopedin.io/the-events-calendar-suite-roadmap#/roadmap).

* Version - The minimum supported version of WordPress is now 6.1.0

* Fix - Prevent TypeError warnings around `admin_footer_text_settings` filter due to type hinting conflicting with other plugins returning null.

  * Now correctly saves in their drag-and-drop order
  * Deprecated the functions added in version 4.6.13 that previously attempted to fix ordering logic but was not done in a backwards-compatible way: `get_order_meta_key()` and `tribe_sanitize_organizers()`
  * We no longer rely on a separate postmeta value dedicated to ordering linked posts (e.g. `_EventOrganizerID_Order`), and you may want to remove all such values from your database after re-saving any events that have linked posts and their ordering is important
  * `tribe_get_linked_posts_by_post_type()` now works as expected, no longer returning zero results in error, nor returning all of the post type's posts if there are none linked. The `tribe_events_return_all_linked_posts_if_none` filter was added, as it is necessary for this fix.
  * Editing an existing event no longer loses the linked posts just because they were not part of the submission. Example of the bug in prior versions: If organizers are editable in the wp-admin event edit screen but not on the Community Events "event edit" form (via template override or other custom code), all pre-existing organizers were removed in error.
