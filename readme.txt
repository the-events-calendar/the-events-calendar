= BUILT SOLID & SUPPORTED =

The Events Calendar is crafted the WordPress way.

The Events Calendar has been audited by many of the industry's WordPress experts including core developer Mark Jaquith for security & plugin review team member Pippin Williamson for best practices and plugin compatibility.

We've poured 100s of hours into QA by a dedicated support team, monthly usability tests to guarantee that it's easy to use, and numerous user interviews to make sure you get what you want. We care about quality and crafting products that thrive in the wild.

The team at Modern Tribe stands by our work and offers light support once a week for free to the community via the WordPress.org support forums.

Installing the plugin is easy. Just follow these steps:

2. Select the Upload option and hit "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears select the the-events-calendar-x.x.zip file from your desktop. (The 'x.x' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful. A link to access the calendar directly on the frontend will be presented here as well.

That's it! Just configure your settings as you see fit, and you're on your way to creating events in style. Now that you're all set up and ready to go, how about checking out the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2l">new user primer</a> to familiarize yourself with what's in store?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar (3.0.0 as of this release). If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar 3.0 is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Twelve theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin's <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">WordPress.org forum</a>, which we hit about once a week. Please make sure to read <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/welcome-the-events-calendar-users-read-this-first">our sticky post</a> providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a PRO license.

If you're already a PRO user, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">PRO forums</a> at the tri.be website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. No post should go more than 24-hours during that time without a response.

= Events Calendar PRO looks awesome! I'm sold! How can I get my hands on it? =

Events Calendar PRO can be purchased directly at the <a href="http://m.tri.be/54">tri.be website.</a> There are three (3) license types available, and all licenses include 1 year of access to support + updates.

= I'm interested in PRO or another add-on, but there are a few questions I've got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed? =

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2w">pre-sale forum</a> at the tri.be site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn't, post a new thread as a guest. We'll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase. Keep in mind that the pre-sale forum is available for questions related to any premium product we've got: Events Calendar PRO, Eventbrite Tickets, Tickets; WooCommerce, Community Events, Facebook Events and the forthcoming Filter Bar.

If your question is simple and can be addressed in 140 characters, you can always ask it <a href="http://twitter.com/moderntribeinc">on Twitter</a>.

= What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar, and where can I read more about them? =

Currently, the following add-ons are available for The Events Calendar/Events Calendar PRO:

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2e">Eventbrite Tickets</a>, for selling tickets to your event directly through Eventbrite.
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2g">Community Events</a>, for allowing frontend event submission from your readers.
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2h">Facebook Events</a>, for importing events directly from an organization or page on Facebook.
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2f">Tickets: WooCommerce</a>, for harnessing the power of WooCommerce to sell event tickets directly on your site without being subject to fees or relying on a third-party service.
* Filter Bar (COMING SOON) for adding advanced frontend filtering capabilities to your events calendar.

= I have a feature idea. What's the best way to tell you about it? =

We've got a <a href="https://tribe.uservoice.com/forums/195723-feature-ideas">Modern Tribe UserVoice page</a> where we're actively watching for feature ideas from the community. Vote up existing feature requests or add your own, and help us shape the future of the products business in a way that best meets the community's needs.

= I've still got questions. Do you have a bigger FAQ somewhere? =

We do. If you check out our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2n">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> on the tri.be site, we've collected and addressed all of the common questions we see posed by users. In some cases we'll provide a Gist; in other cases we'll direct you to a tutorial; and in some situations we'll unfortunately say a certain capability is simply not possible. But the FAQ is a living, breathing document that we're actively updating based on commonly-seen requests.

== Versioning ==

Curious about our versioning process, and how it's changed since The Events Calendar 3.0's launch? Look no further.

As a general practice, version numbers for The Events Calendar, Events Calendar PRO and our other add-ons follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning">Semantic Versioning guidelines</a> whenever practical.

This means releases will maintain a three-part version number: major version; minor version; and patch. Let's say we're looking at The Events Calendar 3.1, as an example:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 0

If we deployed a follow-up maintenance build that addressed a couple small bugs, and called it 3.1.1, we'd now have:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 1

At no point during the 3.0 lifecycle will the major version change. But you can expect that either minor version and/or patch will change with each release. 

== Changelog ==

= IMPORTANT NOTICE =

== Help ==

Welcome to The Events Calendar, a full-featured events management system for WordPress. Thank you so much for using the labor of our love. We are Modern Tribe and we are here to help you kick ass.

If you aren't familiar with The Events Calendar, check out our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2p">new user primer.</a> It'll introduce you to the basics of what the plugin has to offer and will have you creating events in no time. From there, the resources below -- extensive template tag documentation, FAQs, video walkthroughs and more -- will give you a leg up as you dig deeper.

Additional resources available include:

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2v">Release Notes</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">Forums</a>

We hit the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">The Events Calendar forum here on WordPress.org</a> about once a week, assisting users with basic troubleshooting and identifying bugs that have been reported. (If you are looking for more active support, might we suggest buying a PRO license? Our team hits the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">PRO forums</a> daily.)

Some things to consider before posting on the forum:

* Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn't already a discussion going on your issue.
* Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one - if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you've got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your supper request.
* Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -> Settings -> Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and can is worth a shot before creating a new thread.

Still not happy? Shoot us an email to pro@tri.be or tweet to @moderntribeinc and tell us why. We'll do what we can to make it right.
