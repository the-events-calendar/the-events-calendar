== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar (4.6 as of this release). If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fourteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin's [WordPress.org forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/), which we hit about once a week (usually on Wednesdays). Please make sure to read [our sticky post](http://m.tri.be/19oc) providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a PRO license.

If you're already a PRO user, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored [Events Calendar PRO forum](http://m.tri.be/2r) on our website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 24-48 hours during the business week.

= Events Calendar PRO looks awesome! I'm sold! How can I get my hands on it? =

Events Calendar PRO can be purchased directly on [our website](http://m.tri.be/18wi). There are five (5) license types available, and all licenses include access to premium support, new feature releases, and regular maintenance updates.

= I'm interested in PRO or another add-on, but there are a few questions I've got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed? =

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our [pre-sales forum](http://m.tri.be/2w) on our site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn't, post a new thread as a guest. We'll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase.

== Help ==

Welcome to The Events Calendar, a full-featured events management system for WordPress. Thank you so much for using the labor of our love. We are Modern Tribe and we are here to help you be awesome.

If you aren't familiar with The Events Calendar, check out our [new user primer](http://m.tri.be/2p). It'll introduce you to the basics of what the plugin has to offer and will have you creating events in no time. From there, the resources below -- extensive template tag documentation, FAQs, video walkthroughs and more -- will give you a leg up as you dig deeper.

Additional resources available include:

* [Release Schedule](https://theeventscalendar.com/release-schedule/)
* [Known Issues](https://theeventscalendar.com/known-issues/)
* [Documentation](http://m.tri.be/eu)
* [FAQ](http://m.tri.be/2n)
* [Help Videos](http://m.tri.be/2t)
* [Tutorials](http://m.tri.be/2u)
* [Release Notes](http://m.tri.be/2v)
* [Forums](http://m.tri.be/2r)

We hit the [The Events Calendar forum here on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/) about once a week, assisting users with basic troubleshooting and identifying bugs that have been reported. (If you are looking for more active support, might we suggest buying a PRO license? Our team hits the [Premium Forums](http://m.tri.be/2r) daily.)

Some things to consider before posting on the forum:

* Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn't already a discussion going on for your issue.
* Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one - if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you've got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your support request.
* Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -> Settings -> Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and is worth a shot before creating a new thread.

Still not happy? Shoot us an email to support@theeventscalendar.com or tweet to [@TheEventsCal](https://twitter.com/TheEventsCal) and tell us why. We'll do what we can to make it right.

  * Now correctly saves in their drag-and-drop order
  * Deprecated the functions added in version 4.6.13 that previously attempted to fix ordering logic but was not done in a backwards-compatible way: `get_order_meta_key()` and `tribe_sanitize_organizers()`
  * We no longer rely on a separate postmeta value dedicated to ordering linked posts (e.g. `_EventOrganizerID_Order`), and you may want to remove all such values from your database after re-saving any events that have linked posts and their ordering is important
  * `tribe_get_linked_posts_by_post_type()` now works as expected, no longer returning zero results in error, nor returning all of the post type's posts if there are none linked. The `tribe_events_return_all_linked_posts_if_none` filter was added, as it is necessary for this fix.
  * Editing an existing event no longer loses the linked posts just because they were not part of the submission. Example of the bug in prior versions: If organizers are editable in the wp-admin event edit screen but not on the Community Events "event edit" form (via template override or other custom code), all pre-existing organizers were removed in error.
