Feature: single event navigation links

A Site Visitor can navigate to the single event preceding or following the one they are viewing.

Background:
    Given that I am a Visitor on a site with TEC
    Given the site timezone is America/Los_Angeles
    Given that there are 11 events on this site
        | event name       | start date-time        | duration       |
        | strawberry S-T-P | today -3 days -2 hours | 4 hours        |
        | banana M-A-P     | today -2 days all day  | 1 day          |
        | eggplant M-A-N   | today -2 days all day  | 4 days         |
        | apple S-T-P      | today -2 days -2 hours | 1 hour         |

        | carrot S-T-U     | today +2 days +2 hours | 4 hours        |

# technically the above requires that it is between 2:01am and 9:59pm PST
# coded letters in the event name denote whether that event is multi-day or single-day, timed or all day, and previous or now or upcoming.
