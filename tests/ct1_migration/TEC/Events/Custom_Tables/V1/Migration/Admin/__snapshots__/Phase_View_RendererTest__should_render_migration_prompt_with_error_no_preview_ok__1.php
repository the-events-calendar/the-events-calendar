			The migration preview is done and ready for your review. No changes have been made to your events, but this report shows what adjustments will be made during the migration to the new system.

			Your system doesn&#039;t allow us to run a preview, but you can still try a migration. During migration, <strong>you will not be able to create, edit, or manage your events.</strong> Your calendar will still be visible on your site.				<a href="https://evnt.is/1b79" target="_blank"
